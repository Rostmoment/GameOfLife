# Game of life
Reactiation of [Conway's Game Of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life), a cellular automaton invented in 1970, using C# and windows forms<br>
Each cell on the grid is either alive or dead, and evolves over time based on simple rules of birth and survival. You can click on each cell to make it alive/dead

# Controls
Start – run the simulation
Stop - stop the simulation
Clear – reset the grid
Random – fill the grid with random cells (by slider above you can change percent of alive cells in random generation)
Birth if – a dead cell becomes alive if it has this many neighbors (default: 3)
Survive if – a live cell stays alive if it has this many neighbors (default: 2 or 3)
Connect Top/Bottom, Left/Right – toggle edge wrapping

# Simple rules - complicated behaviour of cells
